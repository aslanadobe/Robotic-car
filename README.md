This project is built for a robotic car with mecanum wheels(if not specified).

In expection, the robotic car would use jetson nano as its main brain to do computional jobs and send commands to arduino board, which is used to drive motors and control movements of the car. In reverse, the arduino would also send data from sensors connected to it for jetson nano to analyze and make decision. 

The car would also include Intel T265 camera and Rplidar A2 to do slam jobs as well.
